              took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
              only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
              unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
              Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
              including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`
